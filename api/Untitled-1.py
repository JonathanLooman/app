Code Analysis

Objective:
The 'predict' function takes in a trained model and a list of text data, preprocesses the text data, predicts the sentiment of each text using the model, and returns a list of tuples containing the original text, predicted sentiment label, and the sentiment label in string format.

Inputs:
- model: a trained machine learning model
- text: a list of strings containing the text data to be classified

Flow:
1. The 'preprocess' function is called to preprocess the text data.
2. The preprocessed text data is passed to the 'predict' method of the model to predict the sentiment label.
3. The predicted sentiment label is converted to a string label using a dictionary.
4. A list of tuples containing the original text, predicted sentiment label, and string sentiment label is created.
5. The list of tuples is returned as the output.

Outputs:
- data: a list of tuples containing the original text, predicted sentiment label, and string sentiment label.

Additional aspects:
- The 'preprocess' function replaces URLs, emojis, and usernames with special tokens, removes non-alphabetic characters, and lemmatizes words.
- The function uses a dictionary to convert the predicted sentiment label from an integer to a string label.
- The function assumes that the sentiment labels are binary (0 for negative and 1 for positive).
- The function can be used for sentiment analysis of text data.
